# Twitch Stream Recorder

A simple rust tool to record Twitch streams using streamlink. This tool allows you to record the best available quality livestream of a Twitch streamer without the need for API tokens or complex setups.

## Features

- Record Twitch streams in real-time
- Save streams as .ts files (more reliable in case of failures)
- Option to convert .ts files to .mp4
- Contact Sheet Generation
- Easy setup and usage

## Requirements

- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
- [streamlink](https://github.com/streamlink/streamlink)
- [cargo/rust](https://rustup.rs)

## Setup 

1. Download the requirements and ensure they're all in your PATH

2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fvckgrimm/twitch-recorder-rs && cd twitch-recorder-rs
```

3. Build the program:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The built binary will be in `./target/release/twitch-recorder-rs(.exe)`, you can then move this to a directory in which it will be added to PATH for easier use. 

## Usage

Run the program:

```bash
twitch-recorder-rs [username]
```

You can provide the username as an argument or run without it to be prompted for input.

On first run, you'll be asked to set an output folder for recordings. This will be saved in a `config.toml` for future use.

The program will continuously check for the stream and start recording when it's live. To stop, use Ctrl+C (Cmd+C on macOS). If interrupted during a stream, and convert_to_mp4 and generate_contact_sheet are enabled it will run those processes before stopping.

Note: If you choose not to convert the .ts files, you can watch them with media players like [MPV](https://mpv.io/) or [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/).

### Run with mprocs

An example config for [mprocs](https://github.com/pvolok/mprocs) is provided to allow running multiple instances for multiple streamers in an easy to manage way. Combine with a tool like [zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij) or [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) to allow for background checking and recording.

Once the mprocs.yaml file is set, simply run `mprocs`.

## Configuration

Edit `config.ini` to change settings:
- `convert_to_mp4`: Set to "True" or "False"
- `use_ffmpeg_convert`: Set to "True" or "False" (only applies if `convert_to_mp4` is True)
- `generate_contact_sheet` : "True" or "False"
- `check_interval`: Time in seconds between checks for live streams
